# NLM Cell Knowledge Network MVP

This repository contains the Django and React application serving as the User Interface (UI) for the NLM Cell Knowledge Network (Cell KN) MVP.

## Motivation

The NLM Cell MVP aims to develop a comprehensive cell phenotype knowledgebase, integrating knowledge about cell types, marker genes, differential expression, diseases, and drugs to facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This knowledge is generated by processing single-cell genomics data from repositories (e.g., CZI CELLxGENE, NeMO) through standardized analysis pipelines and by extracting information from scientific literature using AI-driven natural language processing (NLP). The resulting insights, including cell type-specific marker genes and their associations, are structured into a rich network of biological relationships.

To ensure interoperability and facilitate complex queries, the knowledge within NLM Cell is represented as semantically-structured assertions (subject-predicate-object triples) stored in a graph database (e.g., ArangoDB). While the backend processes focus on data ingestion and structuring, there is a critical need for an effective means for researchers to access, explore, and visualize this intricate web of information. The NLM Cell UI (`cell-kn-mvp`) is motivated by this need, aiming to provide an intuitive graphical interface to the underlying knowledge network, making complex data more accessible and interpretable for the scientific community.

## Purpose

The `cell-kn-mvp` repository provides the user interface for querying, visualizing, and exploring the NLM Cell knowledgebase. Its purpose is to enable researchers to interactively navigate the graph-based data, allowing for the creation and viewing of customized subgraphs that represent relationships between cell types, genes, diseases, and experimental contexts. This UI facilitates the visual interpretation of query results, supports the exploration of connections within the knowledge network, and ultimately aims to empower users in their discovery efforts by making the rich, structured data in NLM Cell readily explorable.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.13.x
*   Node.js 22.15.x
*   npm 11.x
*   Docker

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NIH-NLM/cell-kn-mvp.git
cd cell-kn-mvp
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Django)

Create and activate Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

Navigate to `react/` directory and install npm packages:
```bash
cd react
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start ArangoDB

Ensure Docker is running. Start ArangoDB container:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name arangodb-cell-kn \
  -e ARANGO_NO_AUTH=1 \
  -p 8529:8529 \
  arangodb/arangodb:latest
```

This requires previous build of arangodb. See https://github.com/NIH-NLM/cell-kn-etl-results for more details.
> **Note:** Stop/remove existing `arangodb-cell-kn` container or conflicting port usage if necessary.
> 
### 2. Build React frontend:

Navigate to `react/` directory and build React frontend:
```bash
cd react
npm run build
```

### 3. Run Django Development Server

From project root (`cell-kn-mvp`) with virtual environment activated:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
> Server available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
