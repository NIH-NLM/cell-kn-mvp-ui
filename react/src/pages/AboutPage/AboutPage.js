            The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Cell Knowledge Network is a
            knowledgebase about cell characteristics (phenotypes) emerging from
            single cell technologies, integrated with other sources of trusted
            knowledge, sourced from:
          </p>
          <ul className="about-sources-list">
            <li>Validated data processing and analysis pipelines</li>
            <li>Reference ontologies</li>
            <li>NCBI and other information resources</li>
            <li>LLM-based text mining</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A knowledge graph is produced from triple assertions
            (subject-predicate-object) corresponding to biomedical entities
            (nodes) and their relations (edges), and links experimental data to
            the reference Cell Ontology as evidence in support of assertions.
            The graph integrates single cell genomics experimental data with
            other information sources about cells, tissues, biomarkers,
            pathways, drugs, diseases.
